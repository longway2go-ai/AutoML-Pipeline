## 🎨 Enhanced EDA with New Visualizations

### ✅ New Plot Types:
- 📊 **Pie Charts** – Understand class distribution in categorical features and targets.
- 📦 **Box Plots** – Detect outliers and study distributions.
- 📈 **Line Plots** – Analyze trends over time or index.
- 🎯 **KDE Plots** – Estimate and visualize continuous data distributions.

### ✅ Advanced EDA Features:
- **Interactive Plot Selection** – Choose your preferred visualization type.
- **Multiple Column Analysis** – Select and analyze specific features.
- **Target vs Feature Relationships**:
  - Box plots for classification problems
  - Scatter plots with trendlines for regression
